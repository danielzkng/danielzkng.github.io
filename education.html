            <h2>Carnegie Mellon University</h2>
            <p><i>B.S. in Computer Science, 2020-2024</i></p>

            <p>
                I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon
                University's School of Computer Science. So far, I have taken
                courses in artificial intelligence, computer systems, algorithms,
                and theoretical computer science. In the future, I intend to take
                courses focusing on functional programming, type theory, and more
                generally, programming language theory.

            <h2>Inglemoor High School</h2>
            <p><i>International Baccalaureate Diploma, 2016-2020</i></p>

            <p>
                I earned an International Baccalaureate diploma during high school,
                as well as a diploma from the Northshore School District. My final
                IB score was a 41 out of a possible 45 points, including the maximum
                score of 7 on the Mathematics Higher Level, Physics Higher Level,
                and Computer Science Standard Level exams.

            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>While my initial research has been in biomedical engineering and 
            neuroscience, I hope to soon get into research in the field of
            programming language theory.</p>
