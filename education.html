                I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon
                University's School of Computer Science. So far, I have taken
                courses in artificial intelligence, computer systems, algorithms,
                and theoretical computer science. In the future, I intend to take
                courses focusing on functional programming, type theory, and more
                generally, programming language theory.

                I earned an International Baccalaureate diploma during high school,
                as well as a diploma from the Northshore School District. My final
                IB score was a 41 out of a possible 45 points, including the maximum
                score of 7 on the Mathematics Higher Level, Physics Higher Level,
                and Computer Science Standard Level exams.

            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>
            I am currently doing research with 
            <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/">Professor Frank Pfenning</a> 
            at Carnegie Mellon University. My research involves implementing a 
            set of parallel algorithms in a new functional language which 
            expresses parallelism through futures. In doing so, we hope to 
            confirm their theoretical asymptotic complexity, both in terms of 
            the work done when run on one processor as well as the span when 
            given an infinite number of processors.
            </p>

            <p>
            My initial research at the University of Washington was in the 
            field of biomedical engineering and neuroscience. I worked on 
            optimizing code in MATLAB for reconstructing images from plane-wave 
            ultrasound scan data to achieve a better frame rate.
