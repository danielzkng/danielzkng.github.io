                <br /><br />
                I earned my bachelor's degree from Carnegie Mellon University's
                School of Computer Science. I took courses in artificial intelligence,
                computer systems, algorithms, and theoretical computer science.
                My coursework included a concentration in the princples of programming
                languages, including topics in functional programming and type theory.

                I earned an International Baccalaureate diploma during high school,
                as well as a diploma from the Northshore School District. My final
                IB score was a 41 out of a possible 45 points, including the maximum
                score of 7 on the Mathematics Higher Level, Physics Higher Level,
                and Computer Science Standard Level exams.

            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>
            At CMU, I did my senior honors thesis with
            <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/">Professor Frank Pfenning</a>.
            My research involved adding memory reuse to the SAX programming
            language, which is a process calculus based on the logical system
            known as the semi-axiomatic sequent calculus. I was able to both
            extend the language to safely incorporate memory reuse. Moreover,
            I was able to measure the impact of this optimization on various
            benchmarks, both on its own and when combined with memory layout
            optimizations.
            </p>

            <p>
            My initial research at the University of Washington was in the 
            field of biomedical engineering and neuroscience. I worked on 
            optimizing code in MATLAB for reconstructing images from plane-wave 
            ultrasound scan data to achieve a better frame rate.
